# TODO: Add validation for slack and channel integration
# Currently we are taking the channel name (not the id), so it is
# not possible to get the conversations.info api that expects a channel
# id. One possible solution is to fetch all the paginated channels
# via conversations.list and then match the channel name with the provided channel name,
# and then get the channel id (and possibly store in document).
# This is a costly operation and should be avoided.
